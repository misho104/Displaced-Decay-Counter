In the first line, put in the path to your own Pythia8 installation
Pythia8 should have been compiled with a link to zlib, in order to allow for reading *.lhe.gz files.  If you do not use zlib, removev "-lz" in the line starting with "LDFLAGS"
Run "make -jN" in the terminal to compile, where N is the number of CPU cores you want to use
